Abstract

All submissions must include a structured abstract, following the format outlined below.

These four sub-headings and their accompanying explanations must always be included:

**Purpose:** This is where you explain 'why' you undertook this study. In this students will define the objectives of the project. In this students will explain the problem that is being solved in this project. If students are building upon previous research, briefly explain why students felt it was important to do so. This is the opportunity to let readers know why you chose to study this topic or problem and its relevance. Let them know what is key argument or main finding is.

**Design/methodology/approach:** This is ‘how’ you did it. Let readers know exactly what students did to reach your results. For example, did they undertake interviews? What tools, methods, protocols or datasets did they use?

**Findings:** Here students can explain ‘what’ they found during their study, whether it answers the problem students set out to explore, and whether their hypothesis was confirmed.

**Originality:** This is the opportunity to make a clear and succinct case for the value of the results. Students can also reflect on what future research steps could be.

The following three sub-headings are optional and can be included, if applicable:

*   **Research limitations/implications**
*   **Practical implications**
*   **Social implications**
