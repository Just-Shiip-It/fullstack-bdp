Have a look at the summary of the Blood Donation Portal project. Let me summarize what I've done:

## Project Architecture Overview

**LifeDrop** is a sophisticated Next.js TypeScript blood donation portal with the following key components:

### **Technology Stack**
- **Frontend**: Next.js 15.4.7 with React 19, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS v4
- **Backend**: Neon PostgreSQL database with Drizzle ORM
- **Authentication**: Better Auth with role-based access control
- **Styling**: Custom design system with blood-themed colors and glassmorphism effects

### **Database Schema**
Your database has a well-structured schema with these main tables:
- **`user`**: Core user data with role-based access (`user` vs `admin`)
- **`donorProfile`**: Extended donor information (blood group, weight, medical notes, etc.)
- **`emergencyContact`**: Emergency contact details
- **`donation`**: Donation records with health screening data
- **`appointment`**: Appointment booking system
- **`session`**, **`account`**, **`verification`**: Better Auth tables

### **Application Structure**

**Dual Portal System:**
1. **Donor Portal** (`/portal`) - For regular users with role `"user"`
2. **Admin Portal** (`/admin`) - For administrators with role `"admin"`

**Donor Portal Features:**
- **Dashboard**: Real-time stats, upcoming appointments, donation eligibility
- **Schedule**: Book appointments with date/time selection
- **History**: View donation history with downloadable certificates
- **Profile**: Manage personal info, donor profile, and emergency contacts

**Admin Portal Features:**
- **Dashboard**: System overview and statistics
- **Donors**: Manage donor profiles and information
- **Appointments**: View and manage all appointments
- **Donation Process**: Step-by-step donation workflow with health screening
- **Inventory**: Blood inventory management
- **Reports**: Analytics and reporting

### **Key Implementation Details**

**Authentication & Authorization:**
- Role-based middleware protecting routes
- Automatic redirection based on user roles
- Session management with Better Auth

**Data Flow:**
- Server actions for all database operations
- Real-time data loading with proper error handling
- Revalidation for cache management

**UI/UX:**
- Stunning glassmorphism design with blood-themed gradients
- Responsive design with mobile-first approach
- Smooth animations and loading states
- Professional medical interface aesthetics

**Current State:**
- The donor portal tabs are **fully functional** and connected to the backend
- Dashboard shows real donation statistics and appointment data
- Profile management is complete with donor profile and emergency contact updates
- Appointment booking system is operational
- Donation history with certificate generation is working
- Admin portal has a sophisticated donation processing workflow

### **Notable Features**
- **Health Screening Validation**: Automated eligibility checks based on hemoglobin, weight, etc.
- **Appointment-to-Donation Workflow**: Seamless processing from scheduled appointments
- **Certificate Generation**: Downloadable HTML certificates for completed donations
- **Real-time Statistics**: Live calculation of donation impact and eligibility
- **Professional Medical Interface**: Proper status tracking and medical data handling

The project is **production-ready, feature-complete blood donation management system** with excellent code organization, proper error handling, and a beautiful user interface. The architecture supports scalability and the codebase follows modern React/Next.js best practices.
